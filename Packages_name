seaborn -36 plot  Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. 
  It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
dask
  Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing.

Dask is composed of two components:
      1. Dynamic task scheduling optimized for computation. This is similar to Airflow, Luigi, Celery, or 
          Make, but optimized for interactive computational workloads.
      2. “Big Data” collections like parallel arrays, dataframes, and lists that extend common interfaces like NumPy, Pandas, or 
          Python iterators to larger-than-memory or distributed environments. These parallel collections run on top of the dynamic task schedulers.

scipy :- SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, 
    interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, 
    ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
    SciPy builds on the NumPy array object and is part of the NumPy 
    stack which includes tools like Matplotlib, pandas and SymPy, and 
    an expanding set of scientific computing libraries.
pyYaml		
boke :- Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for Python that enables beautiful 
  and meaningful visual presentation of data in modern web browsers. With Bokeh, 
  you can quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

NumPy/Scipy 
  You probably know about these already. But let me point out the Cookbook where you can read about many statistical 
  facilities already available and the Example List which is a great reference for functions (including data manipulation 
  and other operations). Another handy reference is John Cook's Distributions in Scipy.

pandas 
    This is a really nice library for working with statistical data -- tabular data, time series, panel data. 
    Includes many builtin functions for data summaries, grouping/aggregation, pivoting. Also has a statistics/econometrics library.

larry 
Labeled array that plays nice with NumPy. 
Provides statistical functions not present in NumPy and good for data manipulation.

python-statlib A fairly recent effort which combined a number of scattered statistics libraries. Useful for basic and descriptive statistics if you're not using NumPy or pandas.

statsmodels 
  As its name implies, statsmodels is a Python library built specifically for statistics. 
  Statsmodels is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, but it contains more advanced functions for statistical testing 
  and modeling that you won’t find in numerical libraries like NumPy or SciPy.
  Statistical modeling: Linear models, GLMs, among others.

scikits 
Statistical and scientific computing packages -- notably smoothing, optimization and machine learning.

PyMC 
For your Bayesian/MCMC/hierarchical modeling needs. Highly recommended.

PyMix Mixture models.
