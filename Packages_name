dask
  Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing.

Dask is composed of two components:
      1. Dynamic task scheduling optimized for computation. This is similar to Airflow, Luigi, Celery, or 
          Make, but optimized for interactive computational workloads.
      2. “Big Data” collections like parallel arrays, dataframes, and lists that extend common interfaces like NumPy, Pandas, or 
          Python iterators to larger-than-memory or distributed environments. These parallel collections run on top of the dynamic task schedulers.
